#When doing an and operator or else if, here are a few examples you can run to get a feel for the syntax.

!#/bin/bash

age=10
  if [ "$age" -gt 18] && ["$age" -lt 15]
then
  echo "Age is correct"
else
  echo "Age is not correct"
fi
#The command above will print either age is correct or it will print age is not correct depending on the input of age variable.
